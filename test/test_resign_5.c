 *   2. The test process gets executed.
 *   3. The test process does a resign().
 *   4. Since there is no process of higher or the same priority, the test
 *      process gets exectued again. 
 * This tests the double-linked list structure of the ready_queue. (When there  
 * is only one process on the ready queue and there is no other process whose
 * priority is higher, ,its "pre" and "next" should point
 * to itself.)
